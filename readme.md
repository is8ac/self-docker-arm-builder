# Build Watson Self on ARM

To build, clone this repo to an RPi or other ARM device, and run `make`.
This will recursively clone watson-intu/self, build the build image, mount the source in the build container and build self.

# WARNING
This is in no way production ready. Do not use it unless you understand exactly what it is doing.
